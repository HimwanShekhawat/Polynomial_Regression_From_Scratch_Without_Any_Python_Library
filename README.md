# Polynomial_Regression_From_Scratch_Without_Any_Python_Library

This repository contains a simple implementation of polynomial regression using gradient descent, written entirely from scratch using NumPy and Matplotlib.

## ðŸ“ˆ Overview

This notebook demonstrates:

- How to load and visualize data for regression.
- Manual normalization of input features.
- Polynomial feature expansion up to 5th degree.
- Implementation of gradient descent optimization.
- Visualization of model predictions and cost reduction over time.

## ðŸ§ª Dependencies

Make sure the following Python packages are installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
